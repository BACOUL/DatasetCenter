  "summary": "Article 5 lists AI practices that are strictly prohibited within the EU. It bans manipulative and subliminal AI techniques that significantly distort behaviour and cause harm, as well as the exploitation of vulnerable persons based on age, disability or social or economic situation. Social scoring systems that lead to unjustified or disproportionate detrimental treatment are forbidden, as are AI systems for purely predictive criminal risk assessments based only on profiling or personality traits. The Article also prohibits untargeted scraping of facial images to build facial recognition databases, emotion recognition in workplaces and educational institutions (with narrow exceptions), and certain biometric categorisation systems inferring sensitive attributes such as race or sexual orientation. Finally, it heavily restricts the use of real-time remote biometric identification in public spaces for law enforcement, subjecting it to strict necessity, proportionality, prior authorisation, reporting, and transparency conditions.",
